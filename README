This is freenode's Group Management System. It's still in development, and not
exactly useful yet.

If you're interested in development of it, then the top-level directory layout
is as follows:

atheme/:    Atheme modules used (via XML-RPC) to carry out various backend tasks.

lib/:       Perl modules that implement most of the GMS logic. These will be
            used by the web interface, and any other (IRC?) interfaces that may
            be developed.

sql/:       SQL setup files, used to create the GMS database and other such
            tasks.

root/:      Template files and static content for the web interface.

script/:    Catalyst setup scripts.

t/:         Perl unit tests, created by Catalyst.


=== Code structure:

The atheme/ directory contains modules to provide a GroupServ service, with the
following commands:

 - GETREGTIME <accountname> -- returns the registration time of <accountname> as
   a Unix timestamp.

The lib/ directory contains the following packages:

 - RPC::Atheme::Session -- wraps around a login session to Atheme's XML-RPC
   interface.
 - RPC::Atheme::Error -- describes an error result from an Atheme XML-RPC
   command.

 - GMS::Session -- a GMS login session. When created, authenticates against
   Atheme using the credentials provided, then uses the provided 'master
   session' to match up the login details with a unique account ID in the GMS
   database.

 - GMS::Schema::* -- a DBIx::Class schema for the GMS database.

 - GMS::Web::* -- A Catalyst web application.

=== Web interface

Template path is:
    /root/src/_controller_/_action_.tt
