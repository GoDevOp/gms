This is freenode's Group Management System. It's still in development, and not
exactly useful yet.

If you're interested in development of it, then the top-level directory layout
is as follows:

atheme/:    Atheme modules used (via XML-RPC) to carry out various backend tasks.

lib/:       Perl modules that implement most of the GMS logic. These will be
            used by the web interface, and any other (IRC?) interfaces that may
            be developed.

sql/:       SQL setup files, used to create the GMS database and other such
            tasks.

web/:       The web interface, once written, will live here.
