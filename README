This is freenode's Group Management System. It's still in development, and not
exactly useful yet.

If you're interested in development of it, then further information is in the
doc/ subdirectory.

INSTALLING:
==========

IRCd and Atheme
---------------

GMS needs to talk to a running Atheme instance. Atheme needs an IRC server to
link to. Thus, somewhat annoyingly, you need an ircd running to hack on 
the GMS web interface.

For convenience of anyone wanting to test or develop GMS, I've put together a
"quick ircd+atheme" bundle that will do just enough to make GMS work. You can
either use this, or build and configure your own versions. For this 
guide, I'll assume the former.

First, choose your working directory. I'm going to assume that all of your GMS
workspace is in $HOME/gms. Go to that directory, make a subdirectory named
'src', and enter it.

* Download charybdis from http://www.stack.nl/~jilles/irc/#charybdis
* Clone atheme from git://github.com/atheme/atheme.git

In the atheme directory do:

git submodule init
git submodule update

./configure --prefix=<PREFIX> --with-perl --disable-nls
make
make install

In the ircd-seven directory just run ./configure --prefix=<PREFIX>, make, 
make install.

For <PREFIX>, take the base working directory you decided on above. Add 
/ircd for the ircd compilation, and /atheme for the atheme compilation. You 
should end up with an ircd installed in (e.g.) $HOME/gms/ircd, and atheme in 
$HOME/gms/atheme. If you chose a different directory, then the subsequent
commands will vary accordingly.


Next, place the ircd.conf file from http://errietta.me/ircd.conf in
$HOME/gms/ircd/etc, and the atheme.conf fromhttp://errietta.me/atheme.conf
and http://errietta.me/services.db files into $HOME/gms/atheme/etc. 

Run::

$HOME/gms/ircd/bin/ircd
$HOME/gms/atheme/bin/atheme-services

Then start up your IRC client of choice and connect to 127.0.0.1 port 6667.
Check that you can oper up and identify to nickserv:

/oper admin password
/msg nickserv identify admin password

The passwords in these example configs are literally "password". Change 
them if you will -- they're easy enough to identify in the ircd config, and 
`/msg nickserv set password' works as you expect -- but since they only listen 
on localhost it shouldn't matter too much.

Building and Running GMS
------------------------

Now you can start working with GMS itself. Inside your top level GMS 
working directory, clone the git repository:

git clone https://github.com/freenode/gms.git

and cd into the resulting gms directory.

Get a local cpan:
wget -O- http://cpanmin.us | perl - -l ~/perl5 App::cpanminus local::lib
eval `perl -I ~/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib`

You can add the last command to your .bashrc (or equiv) for the local deps
to automatically be useful.

To install dependancies:
(Note:: You may need libexpat-dev or the equivalent package in your distribution!)

eval `perl -I ~/perl5/lib/perl5 -Mlocal::lib`

cpanm --local-lib=/var/www/gms/deps --installdeps .

You also need to edit atheme/Makefile. Make sure the two directories
at the top have the right directory, i.e.:

PREFIX is the path to your atheme INSTALL dir

PREFIX ?= /home/gms/freenode/atheme/

ATHEME is the path to your atheme SOURCE dir

ATHEME ?= /home/gms/atheme

then cd to atheme and run

make
make install

Edit your Atheme config file, and uncomment this line:

loadscript "modules/freenode/gmsserv.pl";
loadmodule "modules/freenode/freenode_prevent_registration";

Then restart atheme.

You now have the atheme-based parts of GMS in place and running.

Now edit gms_web.conf, in the top level of the GMS source tree.

The Model::DB section contains a DBI-style connection string that needs 
to refer to a usable database and username. Once the tables have been set up,
it  should only require insert, update and delete access to all tables in the 
database. To create the tables, permission to create tables,
sequences and indexes will  obviously be required.
Currently GMS is developed with PostgreSQL; others may work but are untested.
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL is a decent guide for
installing postgresql on ubuntu.

The Model::Atheme section contains the settings required to log in to 
Atheme's XML-RPC server. The master_account and master_password
settings must be  for an account name that has the special:GMS
privilege. In my example configs this is "GMS" and "password".

Lastly, the email section controls the sending of email from GMS. 
from_address is the address it will use in the From: field,
while admin_address will  be Bcc:ed on all email sent. Set these to
local test accounts where  possible; if you're working on anything
related to group registration they'll get plenty of spam.

Having set up your configuration file, run `./bin/deploy.pl install` from the 
root of your GMS checkout to set up the database schema used by GMS.

Once all this is done, start the GMS development web server by running
`./script/gms_web_server.pl'. At this point begins the job of tracking 
down what doesn't work and why.

Updating
---------

`git pull` will pull latest from github. If files in lib/gms/Schema/Result
have been changed you need to update the schema: `./bin/deploy.pl upgrade`


Contributing
------------
Fork this, find an issue (or ask #freenode-gms) and create a branch, then
do a pull request with the new code.
