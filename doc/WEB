The GMS web interface is a Catalyst application. Its code is in the modules
under GMS::Web.

There are at present two Models, several Controllers, and one View.

The Models are Model::DB and Model::Atheme. The former wraps the DBIx::Class
schema in GMS::Schema, while the latter is a custom model that wraps around an
Atheme XML-RPC session.

The single View is View::TT, the standard Template Toolkit view.

There is one Controller per 'top-level' task, as should be expected.

Also relevant to the web frontend is GMS::Authentication::*. These modules
implement a Catalyst::Authentication backend which authenticates via XML-RPC
against a running Atheme instance.

Output templates for the web application are in root/src/*.tt. The wrapper
template (root/src/wrapper.tt) is used by all template output to provide the
overall structure of the page; the actual content is provided by whichever other
template is selected by that page's Controller.
