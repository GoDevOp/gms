Brief outline of the group verification system:

When a new group is entered, GMS generates a random verification token, and a
random URL under the project website. These are stored in the database.

The provided project URL is compared to see whether it 'looks like'
<groupname>.tld (strip the TLD from the domain, all whitespace and punctuation
from the group name, and compare the two strings). If it matches, the group is
marked as pending automatic verification. Otherwise, it is marked for manual
verification.

A cron job runs periodically, iterating over groups marked for automatic
verification, and attempting to fetch the verification URL. If the resulting
page contains the verification token, it is marked as verified. It may also
expire old unverified groups.

In the administration interface, a suitably authorised staff member sees two
lists: one of automatically verified groups for approval or rejection, and one
of groups pending manual verification and approval. The former simply requires a
click to accept/reject, while the latter requires the staffer to visit the URL
and check that the token matches before approving it.
