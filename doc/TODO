== TODO list for GMS

For a rudimentary usable release:

 * Finish up the group registration process. There is a rudimentary version in
   place, which needs polishing.
 * Handle addition and removal of additional group contacts, verified by
   existing GCs and approved by staff.
 * Allow changing of user and group information, again approved by staff.
 * Add an administrative interface, allowing:
   - Approving pending groups.
   - Removing existing group contacts.
   - Viewing all information about groups and users.
 * Add a staff interface, allowing:
   - Viewing details of groups, contacts and namespaces, but no contact
     information.
   - Searching groups by name, and by channel or cloak namespace.
 * Add some means, initiated by staff and continued by users, to replace an
   existing group registration. This could be simply marking the existing group
   as inactive, and starting over.
 * Add some means, with staff intervention, to take over an existing group
   registration whose contacts are all inactive.

Further core functionality:

 * Hook in to channel registration, and disallow registering primary channels
   except for approved group contacts.
 * Allow group contacts to request project cloaks directly through GMS.

Possible additional functionality:

 * Add provision for group members who are affiliated with a group, and have
   some access, but are not group contacts.
 * Configurable channel logging, requested by GCs for channels in their
   namespace, and viewable through the web interface with configurable access
   controls (for members as above).
 * Lots of other stuff TBD.
