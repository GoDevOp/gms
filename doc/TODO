The crude TODO list for GMS is "Everything." This file attempts to list some of
the larger projects that are needed sooner rather than later.

=== The registration form

One of the first things that is needed to make this useful is the ability for an
authenticated user to register a new group, and have it make its way to
'approved' status. There are several parts to this project, which are relatively
disjoint.

 - The initial registration form. Let the would-be group contact input the
   group information, as well as his own contact information. The new group will
   enter the database in the 'new' state.

 - Automated verification. This portion will probably run independently of the
   web interface, through a cron job. Verification of a new group application is
   done by checking for the existence of a randomly-generated file name at some
   location under the group's top level URL. If the prospective contact can
   cause this to appear, their involvement with the project is considered to be
   verified.

 - Staff approval. Once a new group has passed the verification, there needs to
   be an easy way for suitably authorised staff members to view it in the queue
   and decide whether or not to approve it.

=== Make Atheme communications more robust.

Atheme XML-RPC auth cookies are valid for a fixed period of one hour, or until a
logout. This includes the master session that GMS uses to carry out internal
administrative tasks. It needs to cope gracefully in the event that its master
session times out or is disconnected some other way.

=== Improve the web UI

The current web interface is functional but basic. Someone more experienced in
web design could make it prettier.

This will likely be an ongoing task, as new modules are written that start with
similar functional-yet-basic templates. In most cases it should be possible to
improve upon the templates created by backend developers.
