The (approximate) layout of the GMS source tree:

atheme/:    Atheme modules used (via XML-RPC) to carry out various backend tasks.

lib/:       Perl modules that implement most of the GMS logic. These include the
            Catalyst modules that make up the web frontend, in lib/GMS/Web.

sql/:       SQL setup files, used to create the GMS database and other such
            tasks.

root/:      Template files and static content for the web interface.

script/:    Catalyst setup scripts.

t/:         Perl unit tests, created by Catalyst.
