The (approximate) layout of the GMS source tree:

atheme/:    Atheme modules used (via XML-RPC) to carry out various backend tasks.

lib/:       Perl modules that implement most of the GMS logic. These include the
            Catalyst modules that make up the web frontend, in lib/GMS/Web.

            Perl namespaces:
            - RPC::Atheme is a set of packages using RPC::XML to provide a simple
              wrapper around Atheme's XML-RPC interface.
            - GMS::Session extends RPC::Atheme::Session with the GMS-specific
              login and account code.
            - GMS::Schema is a DBIx::Class schema providing an interface to the
              GMS database backend.
            - GMS::Authentication is a Catalyst authentication plugin.
            - GMS::Web is the main GMS web application.

root/:      Template files and static content for the web interface.

script/:    Catalyst setup scripts.

t/:         Perl unit tests, created by Catalyst.
