== The group registration process.

This is the process used to register a new group.

Key: [*] Implemented, [/] In progress, [ ] Not implemented

[*] First, the user defines his own contact information.
[*] Then, he fills in the 'new group' form. A group is created in the database,
    with status either 'auto_pending' or 'manual_pending'.

    The status is determined by looking at the group's URL. If it is a domain
    with no directory part, and "looks like" the group name, then automatic
    verification is used. Otherwise, manual verification is used.
[*] In either case, a verification token and URL are created, stored, and
    presented to the user.
[*] The details of the newly submitted group are emailed to the user, and to the
    GMS administrator(s).
[/] A task is run, periodically, to look through 'auto_pending' groups, fetch
    the verification URL, and see whether the page contains the verification
    token. If it succeeds, the group is marked as 'auto_verified'.
[ ] A page in the administrative interface lists groups in the 'manual_pending'
    and 'auto_verified' states, for verification (if needed) and approval. When
    approved through this interface, the group enters the 'approved' state.
