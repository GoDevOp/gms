How a new group is verified
===========================

'Verification' of a new group refers to the check that the prospective
group contact is in fact affiliated in some way with the project in
question. This is done by having him create a page on the project web
site containing a given token, generated by GMS during group
registration.

There are two possible methods of verification: automatic and manual. In
both cases the prospective contact must create the page as described
above. If automatic verification is in use, then GMS will periodically
check whether this page exists, and mark the group as verified if it
contains the given string.

If manual verification is in use, then the group will immediately be
placed into a queue for a staff member to check that the page exists and
contains the required token.

The decision which method to use is heuristic, based on the group name
and group URL. If the URL "appears" to be the group name in a top-level
or large second-level domain (for example, www.debian.org for the Debian
project), then automatic verification will be used. Otherwise manual
verification will be used. The exact method used to make this
decision is intentionally not defined here.

In either case, the group will end up in a queue for staff checking and
approval.
