Registration of new groups
==========================

 * The prospective group contact first defines his own contact
   information, if he has not already.
 * He can then begin to register a new group, via the group registration
   form. This will require the following information:
   - Group type. This is selected from a list of possibilities,
     describing the type of group -- informal, corporation / business
     entity, government entity, etc.
   - Group name.
   - Group URL.
   - Channel namespaces claimed by this group.
   - An address, if applicable. If not, then the 'primary' contact's
     address will be used where one is needed.
 * The following options will also be available on registering a new
   group:
   - Whether to join the Groups Advisory Board, and the email address to
     use if yes.
   - Whether to include this group on the Primary Groups listing on the
     freenode website, and the URL and short description to use if yes.
   - Any other information (one text field, free-form).
 * All of the above information will be validated and stored in the
   group database. At this time GMS will decide whether to use automatic
   or manual verification, and generate a verification token and URL.
 * The prospective contact then creates a page at the given verification
   URL containing the verification token.
 * Once this has been verified, or if manual verification is in use, the
   group enters the queue for staff approval.
