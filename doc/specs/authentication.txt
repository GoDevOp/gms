Authentication and Authorisation in GMS
=======================================

 * Authentication is against a running instance of Atheme, via XML-RPC.
 * Services usernames and passwords are used. Each account in GMS is tied
   to a corresponding services account. This link must be maintained even
   as services accounts are dropped and renamed.
 * Authorisation for GMS functionality is handled by GMS.
 * Authorisation is role-based, based on roles defined in the GMS database.

Privileged and Unprivileged Actions
===================================

Unprivileged users (meaning those logged in with a valid services account,
but without any roles defined) can:

 * Submit a new group registration.
 * View and modify their own contact information, as well as that for groups
   for which they are a group contact.
 * Request changes and other actions for groups for which they are a contact.

Privileged operations will include the following, though role allocations are
subject to change:

 * Staff: View information about registered groups, and which users are
   contacts for which groups.
 * Admin: View and approve pending registrations and changes to existing
   groups.
 * Admin: View contact information for registered users and groups.
 * Admin: Provide replacement tokens for group registration.
