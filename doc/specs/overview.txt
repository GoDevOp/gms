A Brief Overview of GMS
=======================

GMS is the Group Management System, and aims to provide a means for the
freenode IRC network to manage group registration (see
http://freenode.net/group_registration.shtml for a description of what
this means).

The main part of GMS is a web application, allowing group contacts to
manage their groups, and associated channels and cloak requests, rather
more directly than is currently possible. Supporting this are numerous
scripts, as well as a set of Atheme modules to provide the services
integration required.

The web application itself is based on Catalyst; all of the code that
has no pressing reason not to be (such as Atheme modules) is Perl. This
was chosen largely because of its ubiquity as a scripting language for
applications -- using it, we can share the backend code between the web
interface and IRC-facing services that access the same database. This
would not be sanely possible in more Web-oriented languages or
frameworks.

While initial efforts must be directed towards the core web interface,
it is very much intended that GMS will provide more user- and
group-oriented functionality than has thus far been described. Towards
the top of this list is a web service API that groups can use for
integration with their own web applications.
